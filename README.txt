Public Attendance and Participation in Artistic Events
A SQL Analysis
By Jared Korth

DESCRIPTION
A Microsoft SQL Server exploration of results from the 2017 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts (SPAA).
Most queries I used in the process are here, including some data preparation. The cleaned data is also included in this repository as a .xlsx file for anybody who wants to run the queries themselves and see the numbers. Comprehensive data (and the codebook) are available via the link in the credits section of this file.

Each question (e.g., "Do singers attend more musical theater than non-singers?") is followed by the query, then a description of the results with a possible practical application of that knowledge.

Here's to the data-aided advancement of the arts in society!
